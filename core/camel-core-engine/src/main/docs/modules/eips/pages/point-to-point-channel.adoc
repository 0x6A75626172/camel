= Point to Point Channel

Camel supports the
http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/PointToPointChannel.html[Point
to Point Channel] from the xref:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[EIP patterns].

An application is using Messaging to make remote procedure calls (RPCâ€™s) or transfer documents.

How can the caller be sure that exactly one receiver will receive the document or perform the call?

Send the message on a Point-to-Point Channel, which ensures that only one receiver will receive a particular message.

The Point to Point Channel is supported in Camel by messaging based xref:components::index.adoc[Components], such as:

* xref:components::amqp-component.adoc[AMQP] for working with AMQP Queues
* xref:components::jms-component.adoc[ActiveMQ], or xref:components::jms-component.adoc[JMS] for working with JMS Queues
* xref:components::seda-component.adoc[SEDA] for internal Camel seda queue based messaging
* xref:components::spring-rabbitmq-component.adoc[Spring RabbitMQ] for working with AMQP Queues (RabbitMQ)

There are also messaging based in the cloud from cloud providers such as Amazon, Google and Azure.

== Example

The following example demonstrates point to point messaging using
the xref:components::jms-component.adoc[JMS] component:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .to("jms:queue:foo");

from("jms:queue:foo")
    .to("bean:foo");
----

And in XML:

[source,xml]
----
<routes>
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <to uri="jms:queue:foo"/>
    </route>
    <route>
        <from uri="jms:queue:foo"/>
        <to uri="bean:foo"/>
    </route>
</routes>
