= Publish Subscribe Channel

Camel supports the
http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/PublishSubscribeChannel.html[Publish Subscribe Channel]
from the xref:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[EIP patterns].

How can the sender broadcast an event to all interested receivers?

Send the event on a Publish-Subscribe Channel, which delivers a copy of a particular event to each receiver.

The Publish-Subscribe Channel is supported in Camel by messaging based xref:components::index.adoc[Components], such as:

* xref:components::amqp-component.adoc[AMQP] for working with AMQP Queues
* xref:components::jms-component.adoc[ActiveMQ], or xref:components::jms-component.adoc[JMS] for working with JMS Queues
* xref:components::seda-component.adoc[SEDA] for internal Camel seda queue based messaging
* xref:components::spring-rabbitmq-component.adoc[Spring RabbitMQ] for working with AMQP Queues (RabbitMQ)

There are also messaging based in the cloud from cloud providers such as Amazon, Google and Azure.

== Example

The following example demonstrates publish sbuscriber messaging using
the xref:components::jms-component.adoc[JMS] component with JMS topics:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .to("jms:topic:cheese");

from("jms:topic:cheese")
    .to("bean:foo");

from("jms:topic:cheese")
    .to("bean:bar");
----

And in XML:

[source,xml]
----
<routes>
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <to uri="jms:queue:foo"/>
    </route>
    <route>
        <from uri="jms:queue:foo"/>
        <to uri="bean:foo"/>
    </route>
</routes>
----
