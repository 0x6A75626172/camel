:since: 
:supportlevel: Stable

Round Robin Load Balancer. With this Load Balancing policy, a random endpoint is selected for each exchange.

== Options

// eip options: START
include::partial$eip-options.adoc[]
// eip options: END

== Examples

In this case we are using the header test as correlation expression:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .loadBalance()
    .roundRobin()
    .to("seda:x", "seda:y", "seda:z");
----

In XML you'll have a route like this

[source,xml]
----
<from uri="direct:start"/>
    <loadBalance>
       <roundRobin/>
       <to uri="seda:x"/>      
       <to uri="seda:y"/>      
       <to uri="seda:z"/>       
    </loadBalance> 
----
