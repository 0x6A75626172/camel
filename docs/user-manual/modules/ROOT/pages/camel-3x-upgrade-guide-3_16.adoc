= Apache Camel 3.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 3.x to 3.y. For example if you are upgrading Camel 3.0 to 3.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 3.0 to 3.1 and 3.1 to 3.2.

== Upgrading Camel 3.15 to 3.16

=== camel-main

The option `camel.main.packageScanRouteBuilders` has been renamed to `camel.main.basePackageScan`.

Using configuration classes must now implement the interface `org.apache.camel.main.CamelConfiguration`
and the `configure` method now takes a `CamelContext` as argument.

=== camel-core

Change the default from `Override` to `Ignore` in the `TypeConverterExists` option,
and the TypeConverterExistsLoggingLevel from `WARN` to `DEBUG`.

Previously when Camel detected a duplicate type converter during startup, Camel would
override the existing converter and log a WARN. A more correct behaviour would be
to keep the existing and ignore the duplicate.
