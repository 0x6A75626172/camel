= Apache Camel 3.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 3.x to 3.y. For example if you are upgrading Camel 3.0 to 3.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 3.0 to 3.1 and 3.1 to 3.2.

== Upgrading Camel 3.19 to 3.20

=== camel-api

The `org.apache.camel.support.jsse.SSLContextParameters` is now using `ResourceLoader` from `CamelContext`
to load keystore and other resources in a standard way. Therefore, the `SSLContextParameters` now must have been pre-configured
with a `CamelContext` otherwise an exception is thrown.

=== camel-jsonpath

There is a new option `unpackArray` that unpacks a single-element Json array, matched by a Jsonpath, into an object. This option is disabled by default (this behaviour was enabled by default in previous Camel versions). There is a new expression `jsonpathUnpack(String text, Class<?> resultType)` that makes use of this new option.
