= Apache Camel 3.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 3.x to 3.y. For example if you are upgrading Camel 3.0 to 3.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 3.0 to 3.1 and 3.1 to 3.2.

== Upgrading Camel 3.8 to 3.9

=== Modularized camel-spring

The `camel-spring` component has been modularized into:

- `camel-spring` - Core module for Camel Spring support
- `camel-spring-xml` - XML DSL when using Spring XML (eg `<beans>`)

The motivation is to move out the XML DSL from `camel-spring` which reduces the number of dependencies and makes
the module lighter.

Users that use the Spring XML DSL (eg the top XML tag is Spring `<beans>`) should migrate from using `camel-spring`
to `camel-spring-xml` as dependency.

Users that do not use Spring XML should not be affected.

In Spring XML `<proxy>` and <remote>` have been removed. They were only available in Spring XML
and not in the other XML DSLs (Blueprint and CDI).
