[[ConsumerTemplate-ConsumerTemplate]]
= ConsumerTemplate

The `ConsumerTemplate` interface allows you to receive message exchanges from
endpoints in a variety of different ways to make it easy to work with
Camel xref:endpoint.adoc[Endpoint] instances from Java code.

It can be configured with a default endpoint if you just want to receive
lots of messages to the same endpoint; or you can specify an
xref:endpoint.adoc[Endpoint] or uri as the first parameter.

The `receiveBody()` method allows you to receive any object to an endpoint
easily as shown:

[source,java]
----
ConsumerTemplate template = exchange.getContext().createConsumerTemplate();

// recieve from default endpoint
Object body = template.receiveBody();

// receive from a specific queue
body = template.receiveBody("activemq:MyQueue");
----
