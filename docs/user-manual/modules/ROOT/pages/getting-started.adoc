= Getting Started

You can get started with Apache Camel using different ways, such as:

- Using online Project generators
- Using the Camel CLI (command line)
- Using Camel Karavan (visual UI Camel designer)

And these approaches requires more knowledge to perform:

- Adding Camel to an existing project
- Using IDE tooling wizards
- Using Maven Archetypes
- Copy an existing Camel example and modify


== Using online Project generators

You can use https://kameleon.dev/#/standalone[Camel Kameleon] which is Camels own
online project generator. This generator is Camel focused only, which is recommended
for most users to Camel.

You can also use https://start.spring.io/[Spring Boot Initializer] which is the Spring Boot
generator that also has Camel support. However, this generator does not allow users
to fine-grained choose which Camel components, data formats, kamelets etc. to use.

And there is https://code.quarkus.io/[Code with Quarkus] which is the Quarkus
generator that have great Camel support.


== Getting Started from command line (CLI)

Camel uses https://www.jbang.dev/[JBang] for the Camel CLI.
You can easily get up and running in a few steps.

*Step 1*

Open your favorite terminal and use JBang to install the Camel CLI.
You do not need to have Java installed first.

For Linux, macOS, and Windows (using WSL or bash compatible shell like Cygwin or MinGW)

[source,bash]
----
curl -Ls https://sh.jbang.dev | bash -s - trust add https://github.com/apache/
curl -Ls https://sh.jbang.dev | bash -s - app install --fresh --force camel@apache/camel
----

For Windows using Powershell

[source,shell script]
----
iex "& { $(iwr https://ps.jbang.dev) } trust add https://github.com/apache/"
iex "& { $(iwr https://ps.jbang.dev) } app install --fresh --force camel@apache/camel"
----

If it's your first time to install, you'll need to restart your shell.

*Step 2*

Create your first Camel integration

[source,bash]
----
camel init hello.java
----

*Step 3*

Run the Camel integration

[source,bash]
----
camel run hello.java
----

Bang the Camel integration is now running.
You can use `ctrl` + `c` to stop the integration.

*Step 4*

Camel makes it easy to change your code on the fly.
You can run in live coding mode, as shown:

[source,bash]
----
camel run hello.java --dev
----

And then you can do source updates to `hello.java` and when the file is saved,
Camel will automatically do live updates.

*Step 5*

Make sure to look at the xref:camel-jbang.adoc[Camel JBang] documentation, for more details on the powers
of the Camel CLI. You will also find information how you can _export_ what you have built
with the Camel CLI into a vanilla Camel Spring Boot or Camel Quarkus project.

== Getting started with Camel using Karavan

The https://github.com/apache/camel-karavan[Camel Karavan] is a toolkit for visually
designing Camel integrations, and fully integrated with xref:camel-jbang.adoc[Camel JBang]
to quickly try Camel while using the designer.

== Alternative ways of getting started with Camel

=== Adding Camel to an existing project

You can add Camel to any Java project, such as adding the necessary Camel dependencies
to the project build files (Maven or Gradle).

=== Using IDE tooling wizards

Some IDEs have wizards for creating new projects, of which, some have support for
Apache Camel via Spring Boot Initializer or Code with Quarkus.

=== Using Maven Archetypes

Apache Camel comes with a set of xref:camel-maven-archetypes.adoc[Camel Maven Archetypes],
you can use to create a new Camel project.

=== Copy an existing example

You can find an existing example which are hosted on github,
such as https://github.com/apache/camel-spring-boot-examples[Camel Spring Boot examples]
where you can find an example and copy, and then modify.
