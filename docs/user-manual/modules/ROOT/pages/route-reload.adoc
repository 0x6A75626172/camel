= Route Reload

The route reload functionality in Camel is capable of watching a directory folder (and its subdirectories)
for file changes, and then automatic trigger reload of the running routes in the Camel application.

NOTE: You cannot watch for file changes in the Java classpath. It is only possible to watch
for file changes in the file system (i.e. using `file` and not `classpath`).

== Using route reloading

The route reloading can be configured in Java or with Spring Boot, Quarkus in the following way:

[source,java]
----
CamelContext context = ...

RouteWatcherReloadStrategy reload = new RouteWatcherReloadStrategy();
reload.setFolder("myfolder");

context.addService(reload);
----

And with Camel Quarkus / Camel Main you can configure this in `application.properties:`

[source,properties]
----
# turn on route reloading on file changes
camel.main.routes-reload-enabled = true
# the base directory to watch
camel.main.routes-reload-directory = myfolder
# pattern(s) for files to watch
camel.main.routes-reload-pattern = routes/*.xml
----

And in Spring Boot:

[source,properties]
----
# turn on route reloading on file changes
camel.springboot.routes-reload-enabled = true
# the base directory to watch
camel.springboot.routes-reload-directory = myfolder
# pattern(s) for files to watch
camel.springboot.routes-reload-pattern = routes/*.xml
----

=== Must use route id's

When using route reload then you *SHOULD* assign id's to your routes, so Camel
know exactly which routes have been updated. This is necessary because Camel
must stop the existing routes from running, before they can be updated.

Adding new routes is therefore possible as they would have a new unique route id specified.
