[[URIs-URIs]]
= URIs

Camel makes extensive use of URIs to allow you to refer to xref:endpoint.adoc[Endpoint]s
which are lazily created by a xref:component.adoc[Component] if you
refer to them within xref:routes.adoc[Routes] from the xref:dsl.adoc[DSL].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure to read
xref:faq:how-do-i-configure-endpoints.adoc[How do I configure endpoints]
to learn more about configuring endpoints. For
example how to refer to beans in the xref:registry.adoc[registry] or how
to use raw values for password options, and using
xref:using-propertyplaceholder.adoc[property placeholders] etc.
