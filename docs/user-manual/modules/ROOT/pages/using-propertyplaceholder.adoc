[[UsingPropertyPlaceholder-UsingPropertyPlaceholder]]
= Property placeholders

Camel has extensive support for property placeholders, which
can be used _almost anywhere_ in your Camel xref:routes.adoc[routes],
xref:endpoint.adoc[endpoints], xref:dsl.adoc[DSL], and xref:route-configuration.adoc[route configuration],
xref:bean-integration.adoc[bean integration] and elsewhere.

Property placeholders are used to define a _placeholder_ instead of the actual value.
This is important as you would want to be able to make your applications external
configurable, such as values for network addresses, port numbers, authentication credentials,
login tokens, and configuration in general.

== Properties component

Camel provides the xref:components::properties-component.adoc[Properties] out of the box
from the core, which is responsible for handling and resolving the property placeholders.

See the xref:components::properties-component.adoc[Properties] documentation for how
to configure Camel to known from which location(a) to load properties.


[TIP]
**Resolving property from Java code** +
You can use the method `resolveProperty` on the `PropertiesComponent` to resolve a single property from Java code.
Or use the method `resolvePropertyPlaceholders` on the `CamelContext` to resolve (one or more) property placeholder(s) from a string that.






== Bridging Spring and Camel Property Placeholders
TODO: Remove or move to legacy camel with spring xml files

From *Camel 2.10*: Spring's property placeholder can be bridged with
Camel's. See below for more details.

The property placeholder is typically used when trying to do any of the
following:

* Lookup or creating endpoints
* Lookup of beans in the xref:registry.adoc[Registry]
* Additional supported in Spring XML (see below in examples)
* Using Blueprint `PropertyPlaceholder` with Camel
xref:components::properties-component.adoc[Properties] component
* Using `@PropertyInject` to inject a property in a POJO
* *Camel 2.14.1* Using default value if a property does not exists
* *Camel 2.14.1* Include out of the box functions, to lookup property
values from OS environment variables, JVM system properties, or the
service idiom
* *Camel 2.14.1* Using custom functions, which can be plugged into the
property component
* *Camel 3.9* Marking a property as optional, meaning that a property is not set if the property key does not exists


== Property placeholder syntax

The value of a Camel property can be obtained by specifying its key name
within a property placeholder, using the following syntax: `{\{key}}`

For example:

[source,text]
----
{{file.uri}}
----

where `file.uri` is the property key.

Property placeholders can be used to specify parts, or all, of an
endpoint's URI by embedding one or more placeholders in the URI's string
definition.

=== Using property placeholder with default value

You can specify a default value to use if a
property with the key does not exist, where the default value is the text after the colon:

[source,text]
----
{{file.url:/some/path}}
----

In this case the default value is `/some/path`.

=== Using optional property placeholders

Camel's elaborate property placeholder feature supports optional placeholders,
which is defined with the `?` (question mark) as prefix in the key name, as shown:

[source,text]
----
{{?myBufferSize}}
----

If a value for the key exists then the value is used, however if the key does not exists,
then Camel understands this, such as when used in xref:endpoint.adoc[Endpoints]:

[source,text]
----
file:foo?bufferSize={{?myBufferSize}}
----

Then the `bufferSize` option will only be configured in the endpoint, if a placeholder exists.
Otherwise the option will not be set on the endpoint, meaning the endpoint would be _restructued_ as:

[source,text]
----
file:foo
----

Then the option `bufferSize` is not in specified at all, and this would allow Camel to
use the standard default value for `bufferSize` if any exists.

== Example using property placeholders

When using property placeholders in the endpoint URIs you should use this with the syntax `{{key}}` as shown in this example:

[source,properties]
----
cool.end = mock:result
where = cheese
----

And in Java DSL:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .to("{{cool.end}}");
----

And in XML DSL:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="direct:start"/>
  <to uri="{{cool.end}}"/>
</route>
----

A property placeholder may also just be a one part in the endpoint URI.
A common use-case is to use a placeholder for an endpoint option such
as the size of the write buffer in the file endpoint:

[source,properties]
----
buf = 8192
----

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .to("file:outbox?bufferSize={{buf}}");
----

And in XML DSL:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="direct:start"/>
  <to uri="file:outbox?bufferSize={{buf}}"/>
</route>
----

However the placeholder can be anywhere, so it could also be the name of a mock endpoint

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .to("mock:{{where}}");
----

In the example above the mock endpoint, is already hardcoded to start with `mock:`,
and the `where` placeholder has the value `cheese` so the resolved uri becomes `mock:cheese`.

=== Property placeholders referring to other properties

You can also have properties with refer to each other such as:

[source,properties]
----
cool.foo=result
cool.concat=mock:{{cool.foo}}
----

Notice how `cool.concat` refer to another property.

And the route in XML:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="direct:start"/>
  <to uri="{{cool.concat}}"/>
</route>
----

=== Using property placeholders multiple times

You can of couse also use placeholders several times:

[source,properties]
----
cool.start=direct:start
cool.showid=true
cool.result=result
----

And in this route we use `cool.start` two times:

[source,java]
----
from("{{cool.start}}")
    .to("log:{{cool.start}}?showBodyType=false&showExchangeId={{cool.showid}}")
    .to("mock:{{cool.result}}");
----

=== Using property placeholders with producer template

You can also your property placeholders when using
xref:producertemplate.adoc[ProducerTemplate] for example:

[source,java]
----
template.sendBody("{{cool.start}}", "Hello World");
----

This can also be done when using xref:consumertemplate.adoc[ConsumerTemplate], such as:

[source,java]
----
Object body = template.receiveBody("{{cool.start}}");
----



[[UsingPropertyPlaceholder-Examplewithlanguage]]
== Example with xref:components:languages:simple-language.adoc[Simple] language

The xref:components:languages:simple-language.adoc[Simple] language now also support using property
placeholders, for example in the route below:


[source,java]
----
// properties
cheese.quote=Camel rocks

// route from("direct:start")
    .transform().simple("Hi ${body} do you think ${properties:cheese.quote}?");
----

You can also specify the location in the xref:components:languages:simple-language.adoc[Simple]
language for example:


[source,java]
----
// bar.properties
bar.quote=Beer tastes good

// route
from("direct:start")
    .transform().simple("Hi ${body}. ${properties:com/mycompany/bar.properties:bar.quote}.");
----



[[UsingPropertyPlaceholder-UsingPropertyPlaceholdersforAnyKindofAttributeintheXMLDSL]]
== Using Property Placeholders for Any Kind of Attribute in the XML DSL

*Since Camel 2.7*

If you use OSGi Blueprint then this only works from *2.11.1* or *2.10.5*
on.

Previously it was only the `xs:string` type attributes in the XML DSL
that support placeholders. For example often a timeout attribute would
be a `xs:int` type and thus you cannot set a string value as the
placeholder key. This is now possible from Camel 2.7 on using a special
placeholder namespace.

In the example below we use the `prop` prefix for the namespace
`\http://camel.apache.org/schema/placeholder` by which we can use the
`prop` prefix in the attributes in the XML DSLs. Notice how we use
that in the xref:{eip-vc}:eips:multicast-eip.adoc[Multicast] to indicate that the option
`stopOnException` should be the value of the placeholder with the key
`stop`.

[source,xml]
----
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xmlns:prop="http://camel.apache.org/schema/placeholder"
       xsi:schemaLocation="
           http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
           http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring/camel-spring.xsd">
    <!-- Notice in the declaration above, we have defined the prop prefix as the Camel placeholder namespace -->
    <bean id="damn" class="java.lang.IllegalArgumentException">
        <constructor-arg index="0" value="Damn"/>
    </bean>
    <camelContext xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
        <propertyPlaceholder id="properties" location="classpath:org/apache/camel/component/properties/myprop.properties"
                             xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring"/>
        <route>
            <from uri="direct:start"/>
            <!-- use prop namespace, to define a property placeholder, which maps to option stopOnException={{stop}} -->
            <multicast prop:stopOnException="stop">
            <to uri="mock:a"/>
            <throwException ref="damn"/>
            <to uri="mock:b"/>
            </multicast>
        </route>
    </camelContext>
</beans>
----

In our properties file we have the value defined as:
....
stop=true
....


[[UsingPropertyPlaceholder-UsingPropertyPlaceholderintheJavaDSL]]
== Using Property Placeholder in the Java DSL

*Since Camel 2.7*

Likewise we have added support for defining placeholders in the Java DSL
using the new `placeholder` DSL as shown in the following equivalent
example:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    // use a property placeholder for the option stopOnException on the Multicast EIP
    // which should have the value of {{stop}} key being looked up in the properties file
    .multicast()
    .placeholder("stopOnException", "stop")
    .to("mock:a")
    .throwException(new IllegalAccessException("Damn"))
    .to("mock:b");
----


[[UsingPropertyPlaceholder-UsingBlueprintPropertyPlaceholderwithCamelRoutes]]
== Using Blueprint Property Placeholder with Camel Routes

*Since Camel 2.7*

Camel supports xref:using-osgi-blueprint-with-camel.adoc[Blueprint]
which also offers a property placeholder service. Camel supports
convention over configuration, so all you have to do is to define the
OSGi Blueprint property placeholder in the XML file as shown below:

[source,xml]
----
<blueprint xmlns="http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/blueprint/v1.0.0"
           xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
           xmlns:cm="http://aries.apache.org/blueprint/xmlns/blueprint-cm/v1.0.0"
           xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/blueprint/v1.0.0 https://www.osgi.org/xmlns/blueprint/v1.0.0/blueprint.xsd">
    <!-- OSGI blueprint property placeholder -->
    <cm:property-placeholder id="myblueprint.placeholder" persistent-id="camel.blueprint">
        <!-- list some properties as needed -->
        <cm:default-properties>
            <cm:property name="result" value="mock:result"/>
        </cm:default-properties>
    </cm:property-placeholder>
    <camelContext xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/blueprint">
        <!-- in the route we can use {{ }} placeholders which will lookup in blueprint as Camel
             will auto detect the OSGi blueprint property placeholder and use it -->
        <route>
            <from uri="direct:start"/>
            <to uri="mock:foo"/>
            <to uri="{{result}}"/>
        </route>
    </camelContext>
</blueprint>
----

By default Camel detects and uses OSGi blueprint property placeholder
service. You can disable this by setting the attribute
`useBlueprintPropertyResolver` to false on the `<camelContext>`
definition.

=== About placeholder syntax

Notice how we can use the Camel syntax for placeholders `{{ }}` in the
Camel route, which will lookup the value from OSGi blueprint.
The blueprint syntax for placeholders is `${}`. So outside
the `<camelContext>` you must use the `${}` syntax. Where as
inside `<camelContext>` you must use `{{ }}` syntax. OSGi blueprint
allows you to configure the syntax, so you can actually align those if
you want.

You can also explicit refer to a specific OSGi blueprint property
placeholder by its id. For that you need to use the
Camel's `<propertyPlaceholder>` as shown in the example below:

[source,xml]
----
<blueprint xmlns="http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/blueprint/v1.0.0"
           xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
           xmlns:cm="http://aries.apache.org/blueprint/xmlns/blueprint-cm/v1.0.0"
           xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/blueprint/v1.0.0 https://www.osgi.org/xmlns/blueprint/v1.0.0/blueprint.xsd">
    <!-- OSGI blueprint property placeholder -->
    <cm:property-placeholder id="myblueprint.placeholder" persistent-id="camel.blueprint">
        <!-- list some properties as needed -->
        <cm:default-properties>
            <cm:property name="prefix.result" value="mock:result"/>
        </cm:default-properties>
    </cm:property-placeholder>
    <camelContext xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/blueprint">
        <!-- using Camel properties component and refer to the blueprint property placeholder by its id -->
        <propertyPlaceholder id="properties" location="blueprint:myblueprint.placeholder"
                             prefixToken="[[" suffixToken="]]" propertyPrefix="prefix."/>
        <!-- in the route we can use {{ }} placeholders which will lookup in blueprint -->
        <route>
            <from uri="direct:start"/>
            <to uri="mock:foo"/>
            <to uri="[[result]]"/>
        </route>
    </camelContext>
</blueprint>
----

Notice how we use the `blueprint` scheme to refer to the OSGi
blueprint placeholder by its id. This allows you to mix and match, for
example you can also have additional schemes in the location. For
example to load a file from the classpath you can do:

[source,java]
----
location="blueprint:myblueprint.placeholder,classpath:myproperties.properties"
----

Each location is separated by comma.

[[UsingPropertyPlaceholder-OverridingBlueprintPropertyPlaceholdersOutsideCamelContext]]
== Overriding Blueprint Property Placeholders Outside CamelContext

*Since Camel 2.10.4*

When using Blueprint property placeholder in the Blueprint XML file, you
can declare the properties directly in the XML file as shown below:

[source,xml]
----
<!-- blueprint property placeholders -->
<cm:property-placeholder persistent-id="my-placeholders" update-strategy="reload">
  <cm:default-properties>
    <cm:property name="greeting" value="Hello"/>
    <cm:property name="destination" value="mock:result"/>
  </cm:default-properties>
</cm:property-placeholder>

<!-- a bean that uses a blueprint property placeholder -->
<bean id="myCoolBean" class="org.apache.camel.test.blueprint.MyCoolBean">
  <property name="say" value="${greeting}"/>
</bean>

<camelContext xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/blueprint">

  <route>
    <from uri="direct:start"/>
    <bean ref="myCoolBean" method="saySomething"/>
    <to uri="{{destination}}"/>
  </route>

</camelContext>
----

Notice that we have a `<bean>` which refers to one of the properties. And in
the Camel route we refer to the other using the `{{ }}` notation.

Now if you want to override these Blueprint properties from an unit
test, you can do this as shown below:

[source,java]
----
protected String useOverridePropertiesWithConfigAdmin(Dictionary props) {
    // add the properties we want to override
    props.put("greeting", "Bye");

    // return the PID of the config-admin we are using in the blueprint xml file
    return "my-placeholders";
}
----

To do this we override and implement the
`useOverridePropertiesWithConfigAdmin` method. We can then put the
properties we want to override on the given props parameter. And the
return value _must_ be the persistence-id of
the `<cm:property-placeholder>` tag, which you define in the blueprint
XML file.

[[UsingPropertyPlaceholder-Usinga.cfgor.propertiesFileForBlueprintPropertyPlaceholders]]
== Using a `.cfg` or `.properties` File For Blueprint Property Placeholders

*Since Camel 2.10.4*

When using Blueprint property placeholder in the Blueprint XML file, you
can declare the properties in a .properties or `.cfg` file. If you use
Apache ServiceMix/Karaf then this container has a convention that it
loads the properties from a file in the etc directory with the naming
`etc/pid.cfg`, where `pid` is the persistence-id.

For example in the blueprint XML file we have the
`persistence-id="stuff"`, which mean it will load the configuration
file as `etc/stuff.cfg`.

[source,xml]
----
<blueprint xmlns="http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/blueprint/v1.0.0"
           xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
           xmlns:cm="http://aries.apache.org/blueprint/xmlns/blueprint-cm/v1.1.0"
           xsi:schemaLocation="
             http://aries.apache.org/blueprint/xmlns/blueprint-cm/v1.1.0 http://aries.apache.org/schemas/blueprint-cm/blueprint-cm-1.1.0.xsd
             http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/blueprint/v1.0.0 https://www.osgi.org/xmlns/blueprint/v1.0.0/blueprint.xsd">

<!-- blueprint property placeholders, that will use etc/stuff.cfg as the properties file -->
<cm:property-placeholder persistent-id="stuff" update-strategy="reload"/>

<!-- a bean that uses a blueprint property placeholder -->
<bean id="myCoolBean" class="org.apache.camel.test.blueprint.MyCoolBean">
  <property name="say" value="${greeting}"/>
</bean>

<camelContext xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/blueprint">

  <route>
    <from uri="direct:start"/>
    <bean ref="myCoolBean" method="saySomething"/>
    <to uri="mock:result"/>
  </route>

</camelContext>
----

Now if you want to unit test this blueprint XML file, then you can override
the `loadConfigAdminConfigurationFile` and tell Camel which file to
load as shown below:

[source,java]
----
@Override
protected String[] loadConfigAdminConfigurationFile() {
    // String[0] = tell Camel the path of the .cfg file to use for OSGi ConfigAdmin in the blueprint XML file
    // String[1] = tell Camel the persistence-id of the cm:property-placeholder in the blueprint XML file
    return new String[]{"src/test/resources/etc/stuff.cfg", "stuff"};
}
----
Notice that this method requires to return a `String[]` with 2 values. The
1st value is the path for the configuration file to load. The second
value is the persistence-id of the `<cm:property-placeholder>` tag.

The `stuff.cfg` file is just a plain properties file with the property
placeholders such as:

[source,java]
----
== this is a comment
greeting=Bye
----


[[UsingPropertyPlaceholder-Usinga.cfgfileandOverridingPropertiesforBlueprintPropertyPlaceholders]]
== Using a `.cfg` file and Overriding Properties for Blueprint Property Placeholders

You can do both as well. Here is a complete example. First we have the
Blueprint XML file:

[source,xml]
----
<blueprint xmlns="http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/blueprint/v1.0.0"
           xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
           xmlns:cm="http://aries.apache.org/blueprint/xmlns/blueprint-cm/v1.1.0"
           xsi:schemaLocation="
             http://aries.apache.org/blueprint/xmlns/blueprint-cm/v1.1.0 http://aries.apache.org/schemas/blueprint-cm/blueprint-cm-1.1.0.xsd
             http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/blueprint/v1.0.0 https://www.osgi.org/xmlns/blueprint/v1.0.0/blueprint.xsd">

  <!-- blueprint property placeholders, that will use etc/stuff.cfg as the properties file -->
  <cm:property-placeholder persistent-id="stuff" update-strategy="reload">
    <cm:default-properties>
      <cm:property name="greeting" value="Hello" />
      <cm:property name="echo" value="Hey" />
      <cm:property name="destination" value="mock:original" />
    </cm:default-properties>
  </cm:property-placeholder>

  <!-- a bean that uses a blueprint property placeholder -->
  <bean id="myCoolBean" class="org.apache.camel.test.blueprint.MyCoolBean">
    <property name="say" value="${greeting}"/>
    <property name="echo" value="${echo}"/>
  </bean>

  <camelContext xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/blueprint">

    <route>
      <from uri="direct:start"/>
      <bean ref="myCoolBean" method="saySomething"/>
      <to uri="{{destination}}"/>
      <bean ref="myCoolBean" method="echoSomething"/>
      <to uri="{{destination}}"/>
    </route>

  </camelContext>

</blueprint>
----

And in the unit test class we do as follows:

[source,java]
----
/**
 * This example will load a Blueprint .cfg file (which will initialize configadmin), and also override its property
 * placeholders from this unit test source code directly (the change will reload blueprint container).
 */
public class ConfigAdminLoadConfigurationFileAndOverrideTest extends CamelBlueprintTestSupport {

    @Override
    protected String getBlueprintDescriptor() {
        // which blueprint XML file to use for this test
        return "org/apache/camel/test/blueprint/configadmin-loadfileoverride.xml";
    }

    @Override
    protected String[] loadConfigAdminConfigurationFile() {
        // which .cfg file to use, and the name of the persistence-id
        return new String[]{"src/test/resources/etc/stuff.cfg", "stuff"};
    }

    @Override
    protected String useOverridePropertiesWithConfigAdmin(Dictionary props) throws Exception {
        // override / add extra properties
        props.put("destination", "mock:extra");

        // return the persistence-id to use
        return "stuff";
    }

    @Test
    public void testConfigAdmin() throws Exception {
        // mock:original comes from <cm:default-properties>/<cm:property name="destination" value="mock:original" />
        getMockEndpoint("mock:original").setExpectedMessageCount(0);
        // mock:result comes from loadConfigAdminConfigurationFile()
        getMockEndpoint("mock:result").setExpectedMessageCount(0);
        // mock:extra comes from useOverridePropertiesWithConfigAdmin()
        getMockEndpoint("mock:extra").expectedBodiesReceived("Bye World", "Yay Bye WorldYay Bye World");

        template.sendBody("direct:start", "World");

        assertMockEndpointsSatisfied();
    }

}
----

And the `etc/stuff.cfg` configuration file contains:

[source,java]
----
greeting=Bye
echo=Yay
destination=mock:result
----


[[UsingPropertyPlaceholder-BridgingSpringandCamelPropertyPlaceholders-1]]
== Bridging Spring and Camel Property Placeholders

*Since Camel 2.10*

The Spring Framework does not allow third-party frameworks such as
Apache Camel to seamless hook into the Spring property placeholder
mechanism. However you can easily bridge Spring and Camel by declaring a
Spring bean with the type
`org.apache.camel.spring.spi.BridgePropertyPlaceholderConfigurer`,
which is a Spring
`org.springframework.beans.factory.config.PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer`
type.

To bridge Spring and Camel you must define a single bean as shown below:

[source,xml]
----
<!-- bridge spring property placeholder with Camel -->
<!-- you must NOT use the <context:property-placeholder at the same time, only this bridge bean -->
<bean id="bridgePropertyPlaceholder" class="org.apache.camel.spring.spi.BridgePropertyPlaceholderConfigurer">
  <property name="location" value="classpath:org/apache/camel/component/properties/cheese.properties"/>
</bean>
----

You *must not* use the spring `<context:property-placeholder>` namespace
at the same time; this is not possible.

After declaring this bean, you can define property placeholders using
both the Spring style, and the Camel style within the `<camelContext>`
tag as shown below:

[source,xml]
----
<!-- a bean that uses Spring property placeholder -->
<!-- the ${hi} is a spring property placeholder -->
<bean id="hello" class="org.apache.camel.component.properties.HelloBean">
  <property name="greeting" value="${hi}"/>
</bean>

<camelContext xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
  <!-- in this route we use Camels property placeholder {{ }} style -->
  <route>
    <from uri="direct:{{cool.bar}}"/>
    <bean ref="hello"/>
    <to uri="{{cool.end}}"/>
  </route>
</camelContext>
----

Notice how the hello bean is using pure Spring property placeholders using
the `${}` notation. And in the Camel routes we use the Camel
placeholder notation with `{{ }}`.

[[UsingPropertyPlaceholder-ClashingSpringPropertyPlaceholderswithCamelsLanguage]]
== Clashing Spring Property Placeholders with Camels xref:components:languages:simple-language.adoc[Simple] Language

Take notice when using Spring bridging placeholder then the
spring `${}` syntax clashes with the xref:components:languages:simple-language.adoc[Simple] in
Camel, and therefore take care.

Example:

[source,xml]
----
<setHeader name="Exchange.FILE_NAME">
    <simple>{{file.rootdir}}/${in.header.CamelFileName}</simple>
</setHeader>
----

clashes with Spring property placeholders, and you should
use `$simple{}` to indicate using the xref:components:languages:simple-language.adoc[Simple]
language in Camel.


[source,xml]
----
<setHeader name="Exchange.FILE_NAME">
    <simple>{{file.rootdir}}/$simple{in.header.CamelFileName}</simple>
</setHeader>
----

An alternative is to configure the `PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer`
with `ignoreUnresolvablePlaceholders` option to `true`.

[[UsingPropertyPlaceholder-OverridingPropertiesfromCamelTestKit]]
== Overriding Properties from Camel Test Kit

*Since Camel 2.10*

When xref:testing.adoc[Testing] with Camel and using the
xref:components::properties-component.adoc[Properties] component, you may want to be able to
provide the properties to be used from directly within the unit test
source code. This is now possible from Camel 2.10, as the Camel test
kits, e.g., `CamelTestSupport` class offers the following methods

* `useOverridePropertiesWithPropertiesComponent`
* `ignoreMissingLocationWithPropertiesComponent`

So for example in your unit test classes, you can override the
`useOverridePropertiesWithPropertiesComponent` method and return a
`java.util.Properties` that contains the properties which should be
preferred to be used.

[source,java]
----
@Override
protected Properties useOverridePropertiesWithPropertiesComponent() {
    Properties extra = new Properties();
    extra.put("destination", "mock:extra");
    extra.put("greeting", "Bye");
    return extra;
}
----

This can be done from any of the Camel Test kits, such as `camel-test`,
`camel-test-spring` and `camel-test-blueprint`.

The `ignoreMissingLocationWithPropertiesComponent` can be used to
instruct Camel to ignore any locations which was not discoverable. For
example if you run the unit test, in an environment that does not have
access to the location of the properties.


[[UsingPropertyPlaceholder-UsingPropertyInject]]
== Using `@PropertyInject`

*Since Camel 2.12*

Camel allows to inject property placeholders in POJOs using
the `@PropertyInject` annotation which can be set on fields and setter
methods. For example you can use that with `RouteBuilder` classes,
such as shown below:

[source,java]
----
public class MyRouteBuilder extends RouteBuilder {

    @PropertyInject("hello")
    private String greeting;

    @Override
    public void configure() throws Exception {
        from("direct:start")
            .transform().constant(greeting)
            .to("{{result}}");
    }
}
----

Notice we have annotated the greeting field with `@PropertyInject` and
define it to use the key `hello`. Camel will then lookup the property
with this key and inject its value, converted to a String type.

You can also use multiple placeholders and text in the key, for example
we can do:

[source,java]
----
@PropertyInject("Hello {{name}} how are you?")
private String greeting;
----

This will lookup the placeholder with they key `name`.

You can also add a default value if the key does not exists, such as:

[source,java]
----
@PropertyInject(value = "myTimeout", defaultValue = "5000")
private int timeout;
----


[[UsingPropertyPlaceholder-UsingOutoftheBoxFunctions]]
== Using Out of the Box Functions

*Since Camel 2.14.1*

The xref:components::properties-component.adoc[Properties] component includes the following
functions out of the box

* `env` - A function to lookup the property from OS environment
variables.
* `sys` - A function to lookup the property from Java JVM system
properties.
* `service` - A function to lookup the property from OS environment
variables using the service naming idiom.
* `service.host` - **Camel 2.16.1: **A function to lookup the
property from OS environment variables using the service naming idiom
returning the hostname part only.
* `service.port` - **Camel 2.16.1: **A function to lookup the
property from OS environment variables using the service naming idiom
returning the port part only.

As you can see these functions is intended to make it easy to lookup
values from the environment. As they are provided out of the box, they
can easily be used as shown below:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/blueprint">
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <to uri="{{env:SOMENAME}}"/>
        <to uri="{{sys:MyJvmPropertyName}}"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

You can use default values as well, so if the property does not exists,
you can define a default value as shown below, where the default value
is a `log:foo` and `log:bar` value.


[source,xml]
----
<camelContext xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/blueprint">
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <to uri="{{env:SOMENAME:log:foo}}"/>
        <to uri="{{sys:MyJvmPropertyName:log:bar}}"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

The service function is for looking up a service which is defined using
OS environment variables using the service naming idiom, to refer to a
service location using `hostname : port`

* __NAME___SERVICE_HOST
* __NAME___SERVICE_PORT

in other words the service uses `_SERVICE_HOST` and `_SERVICE_PORT`
as prefix. So if the service is named `FOO`, then the OS environment
variables should be set as

export $FOO_SERVICE_HOST=myserver export $FOO_SERVICE_PORT=8888

For example if the `FOO` service a remote HTTP service, then we can
refer to the service in the Camel endpoint URI, and use
the xref:components::http-component.adoc[HTTP] component to make the HTTP call:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/blueprint">
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <to uri="http://{{service:FOO}}/myapp"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

And we can use default values if the service has not been defined, for
example to call a service on localhost, maybe for unit testing etc:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/blueprint">
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <to uri="http://{{service:FOO:localhost:8080}}/myapp"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

[[UsingPropertyPlaceholder-UsingCustomFunctions]]
== Using Custom Functions (advanced)

*Since Camel 2.14.1*

The xref:components::properties-component.adoc[Properties] component allow to plugin 3rd party
functions which can be used during parsing of the property placeholders.
These functions are then able to do custom logic to resolve the
placeholders, such as looking up in databases, do custom computations,
or whatnot. The name of the function becomes the prefix used in the
placeholder. This is best illustrated in the example code below

[source,xml]
----
<bean id="beerFunction" class="MyBeerFunction"/>
<camelContext xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/blueprint">
    <propertyPlaceholder id="properties" location="none" ignoreMissingLocation="true">
        <propertiesFunction ref="beerFunction"/>
    </propertyPlaceholder>
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <to uri="{{beer:FOO}}"/>
        <to uri="{{beer:BAR}}"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

Here we have a Camel XML route where we have defined
the `<propertyPlaceholder>` to use a custom function, which we refer
to be the bean id - e.g., the `beerFunction`. As the beer function
uses `beer` as its name, then the placeholder syntax can trigger the
beer function by starting with `beer:value`.

The implementation of the function is only two methods as shown below:

[source,java]
----
public static final class MyBeerFunction implements PropertiesFunction {
    @Override
    public String getName() {
        return "beer";
    }
    @Override
    public String apply(String remainder) {
        return "mock:" + remainder.toLowerCase();
    }
}
----

The function must implement
the `org.apache.camel.spi.PropertiesFunction`
interface. The method `getName` is  the name of the function, e.g.,
`beer`. And the `apply` method is where we implement the custom
logic to do. As the sample code is from an unit test, it just returns a
value to refer to a mock endpoint.

To register a custom function from Java code is as shown below:

[source,java]
----
PropertiesComponent pc = context.getPropertiesComponent();
pc.addFunction(new MyBeerFunction());
----

== Negate boolean value

If a property placeholder is a boolean value, then it is possible to negate (reverse) the value by using `!` as prefix in the key.

[source,java]
----
// properties
integration.ftpEnabled=true

// route
from("ftp:....").autoStartup("{{integration.ftpEnabled}}")
    .to("kafka:cheese")

from("jms:....").autoStartup("{{!integration.ftpEnabled}}")
    .to("kafka:cheese")
----

In the example above then the FTP route or the JMS route should only be started. So if the FTP is enabled then JMS should be disable, and vise-versa.
We can do this be negating the `autoStartup` in the JMS route, by using `!integration.ftpEnabled` as the key.
